 Story


***ART REQUIREMENTS FOR 0.2*** (Tom)

Seven different robot characters (about 20x20 pixels)

1. Player character - repair robot, robust but relatable (larger than R2-D2 or Walle-E but with some inviting quality), has jet pack

2-6. Enemy characters. Draw from any inspiration (real world drones, Star Wars cleaner droid, whatever). Elemental. Should not look friendly

Animated tile of water (24x24 pixels)
Animated tile of air rushing in one direction (24x24)
