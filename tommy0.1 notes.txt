***ART REQUIREMENTS FOR 0.2***

Nine different robot characters (about 20x20 pixels)

1. Player character - repair robot, robust but relatable (larger than R2-D2 or Walle-E but with some inviting quality), has jet pack

2-6. Enemy characters. Draw from any inspiration (real world drones, Star Wars cleaner droid, whatever). Elemental but not simplistic. Should not look friendly.

2. Crawler that follows walls/objects clockwise

3. Crawler that follows walls/objects counter-clockwise

4. Flyer that turns clockwise upon hitting wall/object

5. Flyer that turns counter-clockwise upon hitting wall/object

6. Flyer that bounces 180 off any wall



Animated tile of water (24x24 pixels)
Animated tile of air rushing in one direction (24x24)
